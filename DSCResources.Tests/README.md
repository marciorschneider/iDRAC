## DSC Resource Common Meta Tests

> Meta.Tests.ps1

### Goals

1. Consistency in encoding and indentations.

  Consistency is good by itself. But more importantly it allows us to:
1. Avoid big diffs with cosmetic changes in Pull Requests.
  Cosmetic changes (like formatting) make reviews harder.
  If you want to include formatting changes (like replacing `"` by `'`),
  please make it a **separate commit**.
  This will give reviewers an option to review meaningful changes separately
  from formatting changes.

### Git and Unicode

By default git treats [unicode files as binary files](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6855712/why-does-git-treat-this-text-file-as-a-binary-file).
You may not notice it if your client (like VS or GitHub for Windows) takes care
of such conversion.
History with Unicode files is hardly usable from command line `git`.

```dos
> git diff
 diff --git a/xActiveDirectory.psd1 b/xActiveDirectory.psd1
 index 0fc1914..55fdb85 100644
Binary files a/xActiveDirectory.psd1 and b/xActiveDirectory.psd1 differ
```

With forced `--text` option it would look like this:

```dos
> git diff --text
 diff --git a/xActiveDirectory.psd1 b/xActiveDirectory.psd1
 index 0fc1914..55fdb85 100644
 --- a/xActiveDirectory.psd1
 +++ b/xActiveDirectory.psd1
@@ -30,4 +30,4 @@
   C m d l e t s T o E x p o r t   =   ' * '

   }



 -
 \ No newline at end of file
 + #   h e l l o
 \ No newline at end of file
```

Command line `git` version is a core component and should be used as a common denominator.

### Markdown Testing

> .markdownlint.json
> gulpfile.js
> package.json

The DSC Resource Common Meta Tests contains tests for validating that any
markdown files in a DSC Resource meet the standard markdown guidelines.

These tests use NPM to download Gulp, which then uses a Gulp file to ensure
that the markdown files are correct.

The 'markdown' tests can be excluded when running pester by using:

```PowerShell
Invoke-Pester -ExcludeTag 'Markdown'
```

It is possible to override the default behavior of the markdown validation test.
By default the common tests use the settings in the markdownlint settings file
[.markdownlint.json](/.markdownlint.json). If the file '.markdownlint.json' exists
in the root path of the module repository, then that file will be used as the settings
file.
Please note that there are currently _only two markdown lint rules allowed to be
overridden_, and that is lint rule MD013 (line length) and MD024 (Multiple headers
with the same content). These are disabled by default, and can be enabled by
individual repositories to enforce those linting rules.

### Example Testing

The DSC Resource Common Meta Tests contains tests for validating that any
included Example files work correctly.
These tests are performed by attempting to apply the example DSC Configurations
to the machine running the tests.
This causes them to behave as extra integration tests.

The 'example' tests can be excluded when running pester by using:

```PowerShell
Invoke-Pester -ExcludeTag 'Example'
```

When a repository is opted-in to example testing, each example file in the 'Examples'
folder must have a function named Example which should contain the configuration
which will be tested.

An optional configuration data hash table can be added for any specific data that
needs to be provided to the example configuration. The configuration data hash table
variable name must be `$ConfigurationData` for the test to pick it up. If no
configuration block is provided a default configuration block is used.

## MetaFixers Module

> MetaFixers.psm1

We are trying to provide automatic fixers where it's appropriate. A fixer
corresponds to a particular test.

For example, if `Files encoding` test from [Meta.Tests.ps1](Meta.Tests.ps1) test
fails, you should be able to run `ConvertTo-UTF8` fixer from [MetaFixers.psm1](MetaFixers.psm1).

## TestHelper Module

> TestHelper.psm1

The test helper module (TestHelper.psm1) contains the following functions:

* **New-Nuspec**: Creates a new nuspec file for nuget package.
* **Install-ResourceDesigner**: Will attempt to download the
  xDSCResourceDesignerModule using Nuget package and return the module.
* **Initialize-TestEnvironment**: Initializes an environment for running unit or
  integration tests on a DSC resource.
* **Restore-TestEnvironment**: Restores the environment after running unit or
  integration tests on a DSC resource.

## Templates for Creating Tests

The Template files that are used for creating Unit and Integration tests for a
DSC resource are available in the [DSCResources GitHub Repository](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResources)
in the [Tests.Template folder](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResources/tree/master/Tests.Template)

To use these files, see the [test guidelines](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResources/blob/master/TestsGuidelines.md)
document and the instructions at the top of each template file.

The resource files are:

* **[Unit_Template.ps1](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResources/blob/master/Tests.Template/unit_template.ps1)**:
  Use to create a set of Unit Pester tests for a single DSC Resource.
* **[Integration_Template.ps1](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResources/blob/master/Tests.Template/integration_template.ps1)**:
  Use to create a set of Integration Pester tests for a single DSC Resource.
* **[Integration_Config_Template.ps1](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResources/blob/master/Tests.Template/unit_template.ps1)**:
  Use to create a DSC Configuration file for a single DSC Resource. Used in
  conjunction with Integration_Template.ps1.

## Example Test Usage

To see examples of the Unit/Integration tests in practice, see the xNetworking
MSFT_xFirewall resource:
[Unit Tests](https://github.com/PowerShell/xNetworking/blob/dev/Tests/Unit/MSFT_xFirewall.Tests.ps1)
[Integration Tests](https://github.com/PowerShell/xNetworking/blob/dev/Tests/Integration/MSFT_xFirewall.Integration.Tests.ps1)
[Resource DSC Configuration](https://github.com/PowerShell/xNetworking/blob/dev/Tests/Integration/MSFT_xFirewall.config.ps1)

## Example Usage of DSCResource.Tests in AppVeyor.yml

To automatically download and install the DscResource.Tests in an AppVeyor.yml
file, please see the following sample AppVeyor.yml.
[https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResources/blob/master/DscResource.Template/appveyor.yml](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResources/blob/master/DscResource.Template/appveyor.yml)

## AppVeyor Module

> AppVeyor.psm1

This module provides functions for building and testing DSC Resources in AppVeyor.

>Note: These functions will only work if called within an AppVeyor CI build task.

* **Invoke-AppveyorInstallTask**: This task is used to set up the environment in
  preparation for the test and deploy tasks.
  It should be called in the _install_ AppVeyor phase.
* **Invoke-AppveyorTestScriptTask**: This task is used to execute the tests.
  It should be called in the _test_script_ AppVeyor phase.
* **Invoke-AppveyorAfterTestTask**: This task is used to perform the following tasks:
  * Generate, zip and publish the Wiki content to AppVeyor (optional).
  * Set the build number in the DSC Resource Module manifest.
  * Publish the Test Results artefact to AppVeyor.
  * Zip and publish the DSC Resource content to AppVeyor.
  It should be called in the _test_script_ AppVeyor phase.

### Phased Meta test Opt-In

New tests may run but only produce errors.  Once you fix the test, please copy
`.MetaTestOptIn.json` from this repo to the root of your repo.  If there is
any new problem in the area, this will cause the tests to fail, not just warn.

The following opt-in flags are available:

* **Common Tests - Validate Module Files**: run tests to validate module files
  have correct BOM.
* **Common Tests - Validate Markdown Files**: run tests to validate markdown
  files do not violate markdown rules. Markdown rules can be suppressed in
  .markdownlint.json file.
* **Common Tests - Validate Example Files**: run tests to validate that examples
  can be compiled without error.
* **Common Tests - Validate Script Files**: run tests to validate script files
  have correct BOM.
* **Common Tests - Required Script Analyzer Rules**: fail tests if any required
  script analyzer rules are violated.
* **Common Tests - Flagged Script Analyzer Rules**: fail tests if any flagged
  script analyzer rules are violated.
* **Common Tests - New Error-Level Script Analyzer Rules**: fail tests if any
  new error-level script analyzer rules are violated.
* **Common Tests - Custom Script Analyzer Rules**: fail tests if any
  custom script analyzer rules are violated.

### Using AppVeyor.psm1 with eXperiemental DSC Resources

An example ```AppVeyor.yml``` file used in an 'experimental' DSC Resource where the
AppVeyor.psm1 module is being used:

```yml
version: 4.0.{build}.0
install:
    - git clone https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests

    - ps: |
        Import-Module "$env:APPVEYOR_BUILD_FOLDER\DscResource.Tests\AppVeyor.psm1"
        Invoke-AppveyorInstallTask

build: false

test_script:
    - ps: |
        Invoke-AppveyorTestScriptTask -CodeCoverage

deploy_script:
    - ps: |
        Invoke-AppveyorAfterTestTask
```

### Using AppVeyor.psm1 with HQRM DSC Resources

An example ```AppVeyor.yml``` file used in an 'HQRM' DSC Resource where the
AppVeyor.psm1 module is being used:

```yml
version: 3.1.{build}.0
install:
    - git clone https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests

    - ps: |
        $moduleName = 'xNetworking'
        $mainModuleFolder = "Modules\$moduleName"
        $harnessModulePath = "Tests\$($moduleName).TestHarness.psm1"
        $harnessFunctionName = "Invoke-$($moduleName)Test"
        Import-Module "$env:APPVEYOR_BUILD_FOLDER\DscResource.Tests\AppVeyor.psm1"
        Invoke-AppveyorInstallTask

build: false

test_script:
    - ps: |
        Invoke-AppveyorTestScriptTask `
            -Type 'Harness' `
            -MainModulePath $mainModuleFolder `
            -HarnessModulePath $harnessModulePath `
            -HarnessFunctionName $harnessFunctionName

deploy_script:
    - ps: |
        Invoke-AppveyorAfterTestTask `
            -Type 'Wiki' `
            -MainModulePath $mainModuleFolder `
            -ResourceModuleName $moduleName
```

## CodeCoverage reporting with CodeCov.io

This is to enable code coverage reporting through
[codecov.io](http://codecov.io) which allows you to report on pull
request and project code coverage.  To use codecov.io, you must have enabled
Pester code coverage, which the first two sections cover.

### Ensure Code Coverage is enabled

#### Repos using `-Type 'Default'` for `Invoke-AppveyorTestScriptTask`

1. On the call to `Invoke-AppveyorTestScriptTask`, make sure you have
    `-CodeCoverage` specified.  This will enable Pester code coverage.

#### Repos using `-Type 'Harness'` for `Invoke-AppveyorTestScriptTask`

1. Make sure you are properly generating pester code coverage in the repo's
    harness code.

### Enable reporting to CodeCove.io

1. On the call to `Invoke-AppveyorTestScriptTask`, specify
    `-CodeCovIo`.  This will enable reporting to [codecov.io](http://codecov.io)

### Configure CodeCov.io

1. Copy `.codecov.io` from the root of this repo to the root of your repo.
1. Adjust the code coverage goals if needed.  See the [CodeCov.io documentation](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/commit-status).

### Add the badge to the Readme

Add the following code below the AppVeyor badge in the main repo `readme.md`,
replacing `<reproName>` with the name of the repo

```markdown
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/PowerShell/<reproName>/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/PowerShell/<reproName>)
```

## Documentation Helper Module

> DscResource.DocumentationHelper\DscResource.DocumentationHelper.psd1
> DscResource.DocumentationHelper\MofHelper.psm1
> DscResource.DocumentationHelper\PowerShellHelp.psm1
> DscResource.DocumentationHelper\WikiPages.psm1

This module is used by some HQRM DSC Resource modules to produce Wiki Content to
be distributed with the DSC Resource module as well as published in the Wiki
section of the DSC Resource repo on GitHub.

It is usually called by the ```Invoke-AppveyorAfterTestTask``` task in AppVeyor.psm1
when the ```-type``` parameter is set to 'Wiki'. For example:

```powershell
Invoke-AppveyorAfterTestTask `
    -Type 'Wiki' `
    -MainModulePath '.\Modules\SharePointDsc\' `
    -ResourceModuleName 'SharePointDsc'
```

## Run integration tests in order

This is only available for resource modules that are using the shared AppVeyor
module model, meaning those resource modules that are calling the helper function
`Invoke-AppveyorTestScriptTask` either without the parameter `-Type`, or has
assigned the value `'Default'` to parameter `-Type`.

>**Note:** Resource modules using the "Harness"-model (e.g SharePointDsc and
> xStorage) must add this functionality per individual resource module.

To run integration tests in order, the resource module must opt-in by calling
helper function `Invoke-AppveyorTestScriptTask` using the switch parameter
`-RunTestInOrder`.

Also, each integration test configuration file ('*.config.ps1') must be decorated
with an attribute `Microsoft.DscResourceKit.IntegrationTest` containing a named
attribute argument 'OrderNumber' and be assigned a numeric value
(`1`, `2`, `3`,..).
The value `0` should not be used since it is reserved for DscResource.Tests,
for making sure the common tests are always run first.

Integration tests will be run in ascending order, so integration tests with
value 1 will be run before integration tests with value 2. If an integration test
does not have a assigned order, it will be run unordered after all ordered tests
have been run.

It is also important that the configuration file and the integration test uses
the same resource name in the file name. For example and integration test for
SqlSetup has a configuration file named 'MSFT_SqlSetup.config.ps1'
and the integration test file is named 'MSFT_SqlSetup.Integration.Tests.ps1'.

Example showing how the configuration file could look like to make sure an
integration test is always run as one of the first integration tests.

```powershell
[Microsoft.DscResourceKit.IntegrationTest(OrderNumber = 1)]
param()

Configuration MSFT_SqlAlwaysOnService_EnableAlwaysOn_Config
{
    Import-DscResource -ModuleName 'SqlServerDsc'

    node localhost {
        SqlAlwaysOnService 'Integration_Test'
        {
            Ensure               = 'Present'
            SQLServer            = $Node.ComputerName
            SQLInstanceName      = $Node.InstanceName
            RestartTimeout       = $Node.RestartTimeout
        }
    }
}
```

## Run unit tests in a Docker Windows container

If the function `Invoke-AppveyorTestScriptTask` is called with *both*
parameters `-RunInOrder` and `-RunInContainer`, then all the unit
tests located in the folder '\Tests\Unit' will be run in a container.
The common tests and integration tests will then be run on the AppVeyor
build worker. This make it possible to run integration tests and unit
tests in parallell.

The Pester output from the container, including errors will be sent to
the console in a Pester like format, and they will also be added to the
list of tests in AppVeyor portal. There is transcript from the
test run that is uploaded as artifact in AppVeyor which can contain more
detailed errors why the one test failed.
> **Note:** The transcript catches more output than Pester normally writes
> to the console since it sees all errors that Pester catches with
> `| Should -Throw`.

If the container returns an exit code other than 0, the Docker log for the
container is gathered and uploaded as an artifact. This is intended to enable
a more detailed error of what happened to be displayed.
The Docker log will be searched for any error records. If any are found then
an exception will be thrown which will stop the the tests in the build worker.

### Artifacts when running tests in a container

These are the artifacts that differ when running tests using a container.

* unittest_Transcript.txt - Contains the transcript from the test run that
  was done in the container.
* unittest_TestResults.xml - Contains the Pester output in the NUnitXML
  format from the tests that was tested in the container.
* unittest_TestResults.json - Contains the serialized object that Pester
  returned after it finished the test run in the container.
* unittest_DockerLog.txt - If the container exits with any other exit code
  than 0 a Docker log is gathered and uploaded as an artifact. This is
  intended to enable a more detailed view of the error.
  If the container exits with exit code 0 then the Docker log will *not* be
  uploaded.
* worker_TestsResults - Contains the Pester output in the NUnitXML format
  from the tests that was tested in the build worker.

  variable for splatting.
* Enable so that missing required modules for integration tests is installed if
  running in AppVeyor or show warning if run by user ([issue #168](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/168)).
* Set registry key HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\PowerShell\DisablePromptToUpdateHelp
  to 1 when running in AppVeyor to suppress warning caused by running custom rules
  in PSScriptAnalyzer in the GetExternalRule() method of `Engine/ScriptAnalyzer.cs`
  ([issue #176](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/176)).
* Added unit tests for helper function Start-DscResourceTests.

    a named property for OrderNumber
    ([issue #191](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/191)).
* Add Script Analyzer custom rule to test functions and statements so that
  opening braces are set according to the style guideline ([issue #27](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/27)).
* When common tests are running on another repository than DscResource.Tests the
  DscResource.Tests unit and integration tests are removed from the list of tests
  to run ([issue #189](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/189)).
* Fix ModuleVersion number value inserted into manifest in Nuget package produced
  in Invoke-AppveyorAfterTestTask ([issue #193](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/193)).
* Fix TestRunner.Tests.ps1 to make compatible with Pester 4.0.7 ([issue #196](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/196)).
* Improved WikiPages.psm1 to include the EmbeddedInstance to the datatype in the
  generated wiki page ([issue #201](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/201))
* Added basic support for analyzing TypeDefinitionAst related code e.g. Enum & Class definitions to include
  Basic Brace newline rules
  * Created new unit tests to validate the Analyzer rules pass or fail as expected for these new rules
* Added Test-IsClass Cmdlet to determine if particular Ast objects are members of a Class or not
  * Created new Unit Tests to validate the functionality of said cmdlet
* Modified current Parameter, and AttributeArgument Analyzer Rules to check for Class membership and properly validate in those cases as well as the current Function based Cmdlets
  * Created new unit tests to validate the new Analyzer rules pass or fail as expected for Class based resources
* Minor code cleanup in AppVeyor.psm1.
* Updated documentation in README.md and comment-based help in TestHelp.psm1 to
  use the new name of the renamed SqlServerDsc resource module.
* Fixed minor typo in manifest for the CodeCoverage module.
* Added a wrapper Set-PSModulePath for setting $env:PSModulePath to be able to
  write unit tests for the helper functions with more code coverage.
* Minor typos and cleanup in helper functions.
* Fixed a bug in Install-DependentModule when calling the helper function using
  a specific version to install. Now Get-Module will no longer throw an error
  that it does not have a parameter named 'Version'.
* Added unit test for helper function in TestHelper to increase code coverage.
* Added Invoke-AppveyorTestScriptTask cmdlet functionality for CodeCoverage for Class based resources ([issue #173](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/173))
* Add opt-in parameter RunInContainer for the helper function Invoke-AppveyorTestScriptTask
  which enables running unit tests in a Docker Windows container. The RunInContainer
  parameter can only be used when the parameter RunTestInOrder is also used.
* Moved helper function Write-Info to the TestHelpers module so it could be reused
  by other modules. The string was changed to output 'UTC' before the time to
  clarify that it is UTC time, and optional parameter 'ForegroundColor' was added
  so that it is possible to change the color of the text that is written.
* Added module DscResource.Container which contain logic to handle the container
  testing when unit tests are run in a Docker Windows container.
* Added Get-OptInStatus function to enable retrieving of an opt-in status
  by name. This is required for implementation of PSSA opt-in rules where
  the describe block contains multiple opt-ins in a single block.
* Added new opt-in flags to allow enforcement of script analyzer rules ([issue #161](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/161))
* Updated year in DscResources.Tests.psd1 manifest to 2018.
* Fixed bug where common test would throw an error if there were no
  .MetaTestOptIn.json file or it was empty (no opt-ins).
* Added more tests for custom Script Analazyer rules to increased code coverage.
  These new tests call the Measure-functions directly.
* Changed so that DscResource.Tests repository can analyze code coverage for the
  helper modules ([issue #208](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/208)).
* Importing of the TestHelper.psm1 module is now done at the top of the script of
  AppVeyor.psm1. Previously it was imported in each helper function. This was done
  to make it easier to mock the helper functions inside the TestHelper.psm1 module
  when testing AppVeyor.psm1.
* Changed Get-PSModulePathItem to trim end back slash ([issue #217](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/217))
